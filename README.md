# IPing
### Improved Ping

IPing (Improved Ping) Is a simple C# Windows Form Program that uses the Ping CLI Tool and gives it more
features as well as an intuitive User interface.

This Ping tool offers a lot of options above the standard ping tool including:
* Easily change Host
* Easily chage Ping Timeout
* Easily change Ping delay on automatic mode
* Easily enable a debug mode wich gives you more data out of the ping

This Tool also offers the ability to send a simple single ping at the press of a button or
clicking the start button and changing the delay allowing it to go into an automatic mode

As well as having all the features mentioned above it also includes some statistics you can see as
they update live per ping, some of the statistics it can track include:
* Average Ping over a number of pings
* Percentage of Pings that got through 

This is a simple, portable and powerful tool and I hope you find it useful too, Suprisingly I made this
without internet and stackoverflow or documentation!! I Made this while the internet is down as a fun thing
that could also be useful to see when it comes back up.

#### TODO:
* Add Tool tips
* Add More Error Handling
* Add a "How to" section
